400MHz-800MHz_rev01a initial variant
400MHz-800MHz_rev01b:
    -Added triplexer before amplifier (uses low band)
    -Moved CE resistor to the bottom side so that it is not on the exposed F mask right next to the shield

2GHz_rev01a
    -Adapted to other frequency range:
        -Changed Balun, coupling capacitor, removed two bands and replaced them with one microstrip LPF.
    -Added triplexer before amplifier (uses mid band)
    -Moved CE resistor to the bottom side so that it is not on the exposed F mask right next to the shield
